The Music Demixing (MDX) Challenge is an opportunity for researchers and machine learning enthusiasts to test their skills by creating a system able to perform audio source separation.

Such a system, given an audio signal as input (referred to as “mixture”), will decompose it in its individual parts.

Audio source separation has different declinations, depending on the signal the system is working on. Music source separation systems take a song as input and output one track for each of the instruments. Speech enhancement systems take noisy speech as input and separate the speech content from the noise.
